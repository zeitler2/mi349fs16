					which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers,
					which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons,
					including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not
					taxed, three fifths of all other Persons.</p>

					make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which
					shall then fill such Vacancies.</p>

					Resident within the United States.</p>

					<p>In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death,
					Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said
					Office, the same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by

					the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as
					President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be
					removed, or a President shall be elected.</p>
