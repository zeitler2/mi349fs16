			<h1>The Outzoner</h1>
			<p>is an online forum for discovering, sharing, and documenting music and videos that are strange, shocking, low-quality, or otherwise "fringe" in nature.

		<div class="maroon" id="longPitch">
			<p><b>Outzoner</b> will aim to provide a one-stop slop for crap connoisseurs worldwide who wish to celebrate their appreciation for audio and visual works whose artistic value is typically only recognized ironically (if at all). The scope of the site's target content niche includes "fringe" artists who express their talents in unconventional or shocking ways, untalented or untrained artists with low self-awareness, intentionally poor-quality or unpalatable productions, and unintentionally comedic "so-bad-it's-good" productions. The website will house pages for noteworthy artists and works; a blog featuring reviews, news, and other commentary; an open discussion forum integrated throughout the site; and (optionally) a dedicated space for user-created content.

					<h3>Party Boy</h3>
					He'd just got done pumping that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X0HuRB5tiY">new IceJJFish single</a> when he got himself fumbled into the Outzoner. Luckily, he intercepted some new jams to throw down at the next big tailgate. His friends like a good laugh, but he better be careful playing stuff like that.

					<h3>Basement Star</h3>
					Tired of all the shiny pop jingles and vapid commercialism streaming in the main, she cracked out a bargain bin mic and booted up her 'puter to make something real. Her folks sure don't get it, but tell you what, an Outzoner just might.

					<h3>Hardcore Nihilist</h3>
					The only mission in this freak's mind is the utter deconstruction of your every social function. He fell in love with a little bald boy named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDoLszwmL4Q">Theevan</a> and sought out similar atrocities to sweep into the void. Outzoner is the broom in this analogy.
