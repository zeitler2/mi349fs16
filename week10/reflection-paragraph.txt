When I started with the style tiles, I based the color palettes largely on those I used in previous lab assignments for this class that I liked. After the first two were completed I found I preferred the font choices from the second one and the colors of the first one, so I went ahead and made a third that put them together. The large majority of the time spent on the style tiles went toward learning the basics of using GIMP. The comp itself took a good deal longer than the style tiles, due largely to my lack of manual precision and hand-eye coordination. I feel pretty satisfied with how it turned out, but honestly I think the html/css product should look considerably neater. I feel like it might have been a better use of my time to type out a prototype rather than play around in a visual editor. That kind of stuff fits the way I think and work better.
