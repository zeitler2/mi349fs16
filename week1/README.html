			<h2>Academic History</h2>
			<p>I am a senior (in credits, at least) majoring in computer science. I
				initially attended Alma College out of high school, eventually attempting to
				major in mathematics and music. I withdrew after two and a half years. Later
				I returned to school, earning an Associate of Science in computer science from
				Lansing Community College. I transferred to MSU last fall semester.

						for music consumption.

					<h3>TV/Movies/Youtube</h3>
					<p>I like terrible comedy shows. I will occasionally watch a decent drama
						show, but I'd prefer it to be either weird or teen-angsty in some way.
						Some favorites include <i>Xavier: Renegade Angel</i>, <i>The Eric Andre Show</i>,
						<i>Twin Peaks</i>, <i>My So-Called Life</i>, <i>Veronica Mars</i>, <i>Freaks and 
						Geeks</i>, and <i>Louie</i>.
					</p>
					<p>I also like terrible movies. I really like horror movies. My personal favorite
						terrible movie is probably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyXohnrEXVA">
						<i>Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky</i></a>. My favorite &#8220;serious&#8221; movie is
						either <i>Taxi Driver</i> or <i>Videodrome</i>. My favorite animated movie is 
						<i>Perfect Blue</i>.
					</p>
					<p>
						I hate YouTube.com but it exists despite my best efforts to forget that fact.
